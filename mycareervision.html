					<b>Passion, Ambition, Humor </b>
				<br><p><b>Passion</b> is one of my most precious values because it drives everything I do. 
					Whether it is at work, in the classroom, or even in the pool, everything I do has a purpose and 
					makes me feel fulfilled. Lately, I have been very passionate about technological advancements, 
					human thinking, and exploring the “why’s” and “how’s” of the world. <b>Ambition</b> ties right in 
					with my passionate nature because I strive to challenge myself in everything I do. I am always willing 
					to take risks with hopes of learning something new in the process. As a collegiate athlete, ambition 
					is second nature. <b>Humor</b> best compliments my driven personality. I find joy in the little things,
					 and I am always the co-worker, classmate, or teammate that will crack a joke to brighten someone's day 
					 or to just create a lighthearted atmosphere. </p></td>
